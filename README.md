# Ansible Repo

This repo consist of the files that will give you the brief idea of creating the automation of Linux machines of various Linux OS like CentOS, Ubuntu, Linux lite and POP OS.
In future I will build various yaml files to automate the various processes involved in maintaining the linux machines.
I will also add the files that will show how to do the automation of Windows machine along with linux, further more the automation of Network.
I hope you will find this repo significantly helpful to study ansible.
